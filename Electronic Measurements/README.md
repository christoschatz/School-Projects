# Electronic Measurements 
- Arduino project for 8th semester course

In this project, a temperature and humidity measurement system with feedback was built using STM32 microcontroller. When the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, a fan is activated. The user can also use buttons to set the desired temperature level
