# Computer Architecture
SystemVerilog project which implements a 5-stage pipeline processor using forwarding technique. This Processor also uses RISC-V instruction set

# Lab 1:

- To implement the MUL and MULHU functions, modifications were made to both the decode and execution stages.

# Lab 2:

- To enhance efficiency, a 5-stage pipeline was implemented. This involved integrating a unit within the decode stage to identify dependencies between read-after-write operations, halting sequential execution until such dependencies cease to exist.

# Lab 3:

- Extend the functionality of tic-tac-toe game so that the user can play against the computer
