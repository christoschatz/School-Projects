# Microprocessors and Applications 
- ARM Assembly project for 7th semester course

In this project the purpose is to create in ARM Assembly a program which could be used in an automatic coffee machine.
The automatic coffee shop will allow the user to choose between four different types of coffee: French, nescaf√©, frappe or hot or espresso. In addition, the user will choose the amount of sugar, i.e. whether the coffee will be plain, medium or sweet. Finally, if you want the coffee to have milk or cinnamon.

In order to implement it, each option was considered to correspond to a two-state switch. Then the result of the user's choices is stored in memory
